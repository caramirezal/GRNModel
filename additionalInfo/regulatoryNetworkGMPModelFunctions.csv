cebpb,  stat5,"stat5 phosphorylation causes cebpb-mediated transcriptional activation of cebpb targets (Xu et al, 2003)."
cjun, ! cebpa,"cebpa blocks transcriptional activation function of cjun TF (Rangatia et al, 2002; Cai et al, 2008)."
egr, ! gfi1 & pu1,"Induction of pu1 promotes egr expression but gfi1 binds to egr regulatory sequences and keep it inactive (Laslo et al, 2006)."
gfi1, cebpa & ! egr,"cebpa promotes gfi1 expression but egr2 binds to egr regulatory sequences and keep it inactive (Laslo et al, 2006)."
gata1, gata1,gata1 directly binds to its own regulatory sequences and promotes its expression (Tsai et al 1991; Tijssen et al 2011).
gata2, gata1 | gata2 | stat5,"gata2 and gata1 binds and activates gata2 promoter (Grass et al, 2005; Martowicz et al 2005; Tijssen et al, 2011). Independetly, stimulation of stat5 forces gata2 expression (Li, 2015)."
mitf, ( ! cebpa ) | ckit,cebpa directly binds regulatory sequences of mitf and maintain inactive. In an independent experiment induced ckit phosphorilation force mitf expression 
pu1, pu1 | runx1 | ( cebpa & cjun ) & ! gfi1," Independently, it has been shown that pu1 (Chen 1995; Leddin, 2011), runx1 (Huang et al, 2008) and cebpa in combination with cjun (Cai et al, 2008) are positive pu1 regulators. Finally, if gfi1 is induced pu1 is downregulated (Spooner er al, 2009). "
runx1, ( gata2 & pu1 ) | runx1 ,"All gata2, pu1 and runx1 binds to a runx1 and activates enhancer (Nottingham et all 2011; and Tijssen et al 2011). However, runx1 was shown not to be critical (Nottingham 2011).  "
cmyb, ! ( pu1 | cebpa ),"In independent experiments cebpa (Soliera et al, 1997) and pu1 (Bellon et al, 1997) were found to be negative regulators of cmyb."
scl, scl & gata1,"gata1 is a positive regulator of scl but only in combination of scl (Ogilvy et al, 2007)."
il3ra, gata1 | gata2 ,"il3ra gene has gata binding regions in its promoter (Levitt, 1995) "
stat5, jak2,"jak2 phosporylates stat5 and promotes its trancriptional activity function (Barahmand et al, 1998)"
jak2, ( il3ra | gmcsfr ) & bc,"il3ra and gmcsfr are receptors that binds independently to respective cytokines and activates jak-stat signaling by binding to bc subunit (Silvennoinen et al, 1993; Watanabe et al, 1996)."
bc, cebpa & pu1 ,"Systematical deletion of cebpa and pu1 binding regions reveals that both are necessary to bc activation (van Dijk et al, 1998)"
mcsfr, ( ( pu1 & runx1 ) | ( pu1 & cjun ) ) & ! ( gata1 | gata2 ),"pu1 and runx1 synergize to activate mcsfr gene (Hu et al 2011). Independently, cjun and pu1 activates mcsfr expression (Behre, 1999), but this is disrupted when gata factors are present (Zhang, 1999) "
gmcsfr, pu1 & runx1,"pu1 and runx1 sinergize to activate gmcsfr gene expression (Hu, 2011)."
gcsfr, cebpa & pu1,cebpa and pu1 directly binds and activates regulatory sequences of gcsfr gene (Smith et al 1996; Radosmka et al 1998).
ne, ( cebpa | cmyb ) & pu1 & ! egr & ! ( gata1 | gata2 ),"Expression of cebpa or cmyb promotes ne promoter activation but only when pu1 is present (Oelgeschlager, 1996). When, the three factors  are present they sinergize. Lack of function egr mutants overexpressed neutrophil markers as ne (Laslo et al , 2006). gata factors promotes basophil or eosinophil differentiation vs neutrophil formation (Iwasaki et al 2006)"
mpo, cebpa & pu1 & ! egr & ! ( gata1 | gata2 ),"pu1 and cebpa in concert activate mpo expression (Ford, 1996). egr downregulates expression of neutrophil markers (Laslo, 2006). gata factors promotes basophil or eosinophil differentiation vs neutrophil formation (Iwasaki et al 2006)"
lf, cebpa & ! egr & ! ( gata1 | gata2 ),"cebpa activates lf gene promoter (Khanna-Gupta et al, 2003) "
mbp, ( ( cebpa | cebpb ) & ( gata1 | gata2 ) & pu1 ) & !  ( gfi1 & gcsfr ),"cebp and gata factors sinyergize with pu1 to activate mbp gene (Du et al, 2002). Independently, gfi1 inhibits mbp during gcsfr stimulation (Liu et al, 2011)."
mmcp6, mitf & ckit & cjun,"mitf pathway activated by ckit stimulation causes mmcp6 expression (Morii et al 1994). cjun synergizes with mitf to activate mmcp6 transcription (Kim et al, 2004)"
mccpa, gata2 & mitf & ckit,"gata2 directly binds regulatory sequences and activates mccpa gene transcription (Zon et al, 1991). ckit-mitf1 signaling activates mccpa activation (Gurish et al, 1992). "
ckit, ( ( scl & gata1 ) | gata2 ) & mitf,"gata1 is an positive regulator of ckit gene but only in the presence of scl (Tripic et al, 2009). Independently, gata2 activates ckit gene (Maeda, 2010).  ckit transactivates ckit promoter (Tsujimura et al 1996)."
fceRIb, gata1,"gata1 binds regulatory sequences of fceRIb gene and activates its expression (Maeda et al, 2003)"
fceRIa, ( gata1 | gata2 ) & pu1,"gata factors directly binds and positively regulates regulatory sequences of the fceRIa gene (Nishiyama et al, 2002)."
ccr3, cebpa & gata1 & pu1 & runx1,"gata1, pu1 and runx1 directly binds regulatory sequences of ccr3 gene (Kim et al, 2010; Kong et al, 2016). cebpa is a major TF required to the expression of eosinophil markers (Iwasaki et al, 2006)."
