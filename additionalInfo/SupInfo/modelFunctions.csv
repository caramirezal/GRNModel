gmcsfr, pu1 & runx1,pu1 and runx1 sinergize to activate gmcsfr gene expression (PMID:21518930).
gcsfr, cebpa & pu1,cebpa and pu1 directly binds and activates regulatory sequences of gcsfr gene (PMID:8695841;  PMID:9632814).
ne, ( cebpa | cmyb ) & pu1 & ! egr & ! ( gata1 | gata2 ),"Expression of cebpa or cmyb promotes ne promoter activation but only when pu1 is present (PMID:8756629). When, the three factors  are present they sinergize. Lack of function egr mutants overexpressed neutrophil markers as ne (PMID:16923394). gata factors promotes basophil or eosinophil differentiation vs neutrophil formation (PMID:17079688)."
mpo, cebpa & pu1 & ! egr & ! ( gata1 | gata2 ),pu1 and cebpa in concert activate mpo expression (PMID:17079688). egr downregulates expression of neutrophil markers (PMID:16923394). gata factors promotes basophil or eosinophil differentiation vs neutrophil formation (PMID:17079688)
