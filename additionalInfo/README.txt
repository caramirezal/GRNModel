GMPModelFunctions.xlsx


The GMPModelFunctions.xlsx contains a table with the Boolean functions for each node in the model. The table contains the following columns:

 - node: the variable node name as appears in the model implementation.

 - factors: refers to the Boolean function for the corresponding node. Where "&", "|", ando "!" represent "AND", "OR", and "NOT" Boolean operators. Boolean subexpressions of direct interactions are shown in black, whilst indirect and/or proposed interactions are shown in green.

 - Boolean expression details: give a description of the experimental findings which leaves to the definition of each model Boolean function.
